# Control

## Status

**Software parity accepted at `d1c803e`; real Raspberry acceptance pending
hardware availability.**

Control is the first product page with product-owned live DSP semantics. Its
live mode is entered through:

```text
/estack-dsp/?transport=camillanode#control
```

It does not load fixture/mock operational data in that mode.

## Product files

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `public/prototypes/estack-ui/pages/control/live-page.js` | Presentation, user events and rendering only |
| `public/prototypes/estack-ui/shared/domain/pipeline.js` | CamillaDSP 4.x/legacy Filter-step normalization and post-mixer chain discovery |
| `public/prototypes/estack-ui/shared/domain/control-model.js` | Pure Control graph discovery and structural invariants |
| `public/prototypes/estack-ui/shared/domain/control-service.js` | Reads, telemetry, transactions, links and headroom semantics |
| `public/prototypes/estack-ui/shared/estack-dsp-bridge.js` | Only browser transport for `/ws/dsp`, `/ws/spectrum` and same-origin APIs |

## Reads

- `GetVolume` for Master;
- `GetCaptureSignalPeak` for capture/input meters;
- one shared `GetPlaybackSignalPeak` loop for output meters;
- `GetConfigJson` before/after configuration transactions;
- `/ws/spectrum` for spectrum data.

## Writes

- `SetVolume` for Master only;
- guarded narrow Gain/mute changes on actual post-mixer per-way Gain filters;
- guarded Input Trim transaction using `ESTACK_INPUT_PREAMP` and its dedicated
  pre-mixer stage;
- guarded Normalize transaction applying one common way-gain shift.

## Safety invariants

- Active ways come from explicit first-mixer destinations. E-Stack uses outputs
  `0…5`; unused playback outputs `6/7` are not presented as ways.
- Per-way gain discovery only traverses direct **post-mixer** Filter steps, so
  pre-mixer Input Trim cannot be selected as a way Gain.
- Final hard-limit discovery scans all post-mixer steps, including the final
  Limiter-only steps after protection processors.
- Device, mixer, pipeline, processor, crossover, PEQ, delay, limiter and
  unrelated filter state must remain identical for a narrow Gain/mute write.
- Input Trim/Normalize check Measurement Batch and Signal Generator locks,
  attenuate Master to `−60 dB` during graph changes, read back, verify exact
  scope and restore Master even on failure.
- Headroom uses live Compressor thresholds and Limiter `clip_limit`, a 4-second
  peak hold, calibrated voltage model and `−90 dBFS` no-signal threshold.
  Silence yields `WAITING` / `PLAY SIGNAL`; automatic Input Trim is unavailable.
- MID/HIGH links apply to Gain changes only. Mute remains per selected way.

## Pending Raspberry acceptance

When hardware is available, run the staged Control protocol:

1. Read-only transport/topology/meter/spectrum validation.
2. Reversible Master, SUB gain, MID linked gain and independent MID mute checks.
3. Small reversible Input Trim transaction; inspect Normalize preview first.
4. Final complete live-config comparison against the pre-test snapshot.

Do not run Signal Generator or Measurement Batch during that acceptance. Stop
at the first readback/invariant failure and restore only through the recorded
snapshot/explicit guarded transaction.
