# DSP safety model

## Standard product configuration transaction

When a product domain service must make a narrow CamillaDSP configuration
change, it follows this sequence:

1. Read the live configuration.
2. Check incompatible active workflows where applicable.
3. Snapshot relevant state, including the current Master where a graph swap is
   involved.
4. Discover and validate the exact target scope in the live graph.
5. Attenuate Master when the operation replaces/uploads a processing graph.
6. Apply only the targeted mutation to a cloned configuration.
7. Validate allowed structure and protected invariants before upload.
8. Send `SetConfigJson` through the shared domain service and bridge.
9. Read the configuration back.
10. Verify that only allowed differences occurred.
11. Restore Master and temporary state even if an operation fails.

Page UI must not duplicate this sequence. The page calls a domain service and
renders its result. Every safety-critical change requires regression coverage
for the protected invariant.

## Existing server-owned safety workflows

Do **not** reimplement these workflows in a product domain module:

- **Measurement Batch:** server captures a baseline, applies validated temporary
  deltas, owns measurement routing and restores baseline processing/routing.
- **Signal Generator:** server snapshots the normal configuration, restricts
  routing, has timeout/page-exit/restart recovery and restores it.
- **Loudness:** its backend owns live preset application and persistence rules.
- **Startup recall:** the backend restores selected processing safely at boot
  while retaining hardware devices/mixers owned by the live YAML.

Product pages call their same-origin APIs and display returned state.

## Control-specific application

Control way gain/mute uses a narrow mutation with device, mixer, pipeline,
processor, crossover, PEQ, delay and limiter invariants. Input Trim and
Normalize also lock against an active Measurement Batch or Signal Generator and
use a temporary `−60 dB` Master transition with readback and restoration. See
[Control](pages/control.md).

## Hardware acceptance

Code tests are not hardware acceptance. Real DSP writes require an explicit
hardware task, an initial live snapshot, reversible steps, readback checks and
restoration. If any invariant fails, stop; do not fix forward on the Raspberry.
